# Overview
This project is simply to test out and see how to make my docker daemon listen to a docker process and execute another docker container
What will be contained in this project is an api (as a docker container) that will be able to communicate with the docker daemon
to spin up a docker process whenever one of its endpoints is reached.

## Getting Started
Start the virtual environment by running the command

source venv/bin/activate
